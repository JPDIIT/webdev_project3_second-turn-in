      <p>"Most people don't look up."</p>
      <p>No five words can better express why so many people miss the appeal, importance and excitement of astronomy. Is astronomy a luxury, a peculiar hobby, an 
      unimportant field of study that's irrelevant to the necessities of daily life? Have you ever used anything that crossed an ocean to reach you? Do you or does  
      anyone you know live where you are because of ancestors who crossed a sea or ocean? Do you eat food that came from farms? Have you ever used a calendar? Have 
      you ever used a clock?</p>
      <p>Little or nothing of the modern civilized world would exist without the study of astronomy. Ships would never cross the open seas, except by blind luck, without
      celestial navigation. All calendars were derived by tracking the procession of "sunrises" and "sunsets" along the horizon between the solstices, and by 
      observing the phases of the Moon. Without calendars to reliably track the growing season, agriculture would also be impractical, and therefore so would cities.
      All modern clocks originated from sundials, which were astronomical tools that measured the rotation of the Earth by tracking the shadows cast by the sun.
      Consider everything in history, business, finance, industry, science, technology and civilization that owes its existence to navigation, calendars, clocks 
      and every other practical application of astronomy. All of these things exist today because some curious human beings in distant prehistory decided to momentarily 
      set aside the drudgery of their harsh, short lives and look up.</p>

        <figcaption>Stonehenge: The world's oldest, (mostly) working calendar</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While it's true that most people will live long, full lives without ever once having to perform any astronomical observations or calculations, that doesn't 
      mean that they aren't missing anything. You don't have to be a professional astronomer to appreciate astronomy. If you can appreciate the beauty of nature in our 
      world, then you can appreciate the beauty of the boundless nature that lies beyond it. The appreciation of astronomy is fundamentally the appreciation of 
      transcendant beauty at an incomprehensible scale. When you look at the Andromeda Galaxy, our galaxy's closest neighbor, for example, you are looking at over a trillion stars 
      that are over two million light-years away. You are gazing on a view from over two million years in the past, carried to you by photons that traveled for over 
      11,760,000,000,000,000,000 miles, for over two million years, to show you something over 893,760,000,000,000,000 miles wide, which is now inside your eye.</p>
      <p>Whether you've always been interested in astronomy, or have just recently become curious, welcome to a guide of things to lookup before you "look up."</p>

      <h2>Telescopes</h2>
      <section id="scope-attributes">
        <h3>What the Optics Are</h3>
        <p>The telescope is a tool that brings the light of the visible universe to your eye. The two most important attributes of every telescope are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aperture Size</li>
          <li>Focal Length</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aperture size is the diameter of the opening where light enters the telescope. Larger apertures allow more light to enter. This not only allows 
        you to observe more of the sky at once, but also improves the visibility of fainter objects by drawing in more of their light. The human iris 
        increases the size of the eye's aperture (the pupil) in darker environments, for the same reason and to the same effect.</p>
        <p>Focal length is the distance that the light travels from the lens or mirror that begins focusing it, to the point at which it focuses. Longer
        focal lengths result in more powerful magnification, but they also increase the necessary length of the scope.</p>
        <p>The focal ratio, "f-number" or "speed" is derived by dividing the focal length by the aperture width. For F/5, the focal length is five times the amount
        of the aperture's diameter, for F/6, it's six times, F/8, eight times, etc. F/5 is considered "faster" than F/6, F/6 than F/8, etc. Faster, larger focal ratios give
        a wider field of view at lower magnification, while slower, smaller focal ratios give a narrower field of view at higher magnification. An eye-piece's own 
        magnification power and field of view modify this further.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="scope-optics">
        <h3>How the Optics Work</h3>
        <p>There are three main types of telescopes, based on their optics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Refractors</li>
          <li>Reflectors</li>
          <li>Catadioptrics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refractors are what the average person thinks of when imagining a telescope. Galileo's telescope was a refractor. Huygens' telescope was a refractor.
        The pirate Blackbeard's telescope was a refractor. Refractors use a glass lens near the front of the tube to bend and focus light to a point at the back, 
        where a lens in the eye-piece focuses it further. A mirror or prism can also bend the light at an angle into the eye-piece for the ergonomics of the observer. 
        Refractors are more common for smaller, introductory-level telescopes, since the cost of making larger lenses quickly becomes prohibitive for the amateur 
        market beyond around five inches in diameter. Beyond that point, the prices become astronomical.</p>
        <figure class="centered">
          <img src="images/refractor1.svg" alt="Diagram of a refracting telescope, showing light paths and focus point">
          <figcaption>A diagram of a refracting telescope, note the lens on the aperture end (left) and focus in eye-piece (right)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Reflectors are much less common, but are useful for serious amateur astronomers who operate on a limited budget. Typically, a concave mirror at the back 
        of the tube focuses light to another mirror near the front. This mirror then reflects light into the eye-piece, which is often near the front of the tube.
        Newtonian reflectors are the most common type of reflecting telescope. They are also typically the least expensive and lowest maintenance.</p>
        <figure class="centered">
          <img src="images/reflector1.svg" alt="Diagram of a reflecting telescope, showing light paths and focus point">
          <figcaption>A diagram of a Newtonian reflecting telescope, note the eypiece near the open aperture end (left) and focusing mirror on the bottom
          of the telescope tube (right.)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Catadioptric telescopes use a combination of reflecting and refracting optics. There is a wide variety of catadioptric designs, from the notoriously
        unreliable "Bird-Jones," to the powerful and compact (but expensive) "Schmitt-Cassegrain." The two main benefits to catadioptric designs are mutual problem 
        correction between reflector and refractor designs, and bending the light focusing path back over itself to pack a longer focal length into a shorter tube.
        The cheapest models are so unreliable as to be mostly useless, and the more reliable designs can be so expensive as to be cost prohibitive. Don't buy one 
        unless you know what you're doing, and don't try to build one unless you're a professional.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="telescope-mounts">
        <h3>Mounts</h3>
        <p>All tubes sit on one of two main types of mounts, based on how they turn:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Alt-Azimuth</li>
          <li>Equatorial</li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="left-image">
          <img src="images/dobsonian_telescope.jpg" alt="Photo of a Dobsonian telescope, open truss design, in green field during the daytime">
          <figcaption>A dobsonian telescope, which uses an alt-azimuth mount</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="clear-right"> Alt-azimuth mounts are the easiest to operate and most intuitive to understand. They turn the scope up or down and left or right. The simplicity of
        this type of mount is reflected in how inexpensive it can be. A favorite design of amateur astronomers is the "Dobsonian Telescope," a Newtonian reflector 
        that sits on an alt-azimuth mount. The design maximizes power while minimizing expense, by using a simple rocker box that sits on a turntable, all of which
        moves and stops with the friction of simple teflon bearings. Enormous telescopes with apertures up to four feet wide, and tube assemblies 20 feet long can be
        easily moved by hand, albeit by an operator who is standing on a ladder. Amateurs have been perfecting the design for over three generations. If there's 
        anything that could be called an "open source telescope," this is it.</p>
        <figure class="right-image">
          <img src="images/equatorial_mount.jpg" alt="Close-up photo of an equatorial mount, showing its axes and counterweight">
          <figcaption>An equatorial mount</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Equatorial mounts are more complex and expensive, but they can find and track astronomical objects much more easily. Before use, the mount must first set 
        its "polar alignment." In the Northern Hemisphere, this is set by pointing the telescope to the North Celestial Pole (found near Polaris, the "North Star.") 
        In the Southern Hemisphere, the process is more complicated (since there is no "South Star") but still achievable with some effort and practice. One axis of 
        the mount rotates parallel to the pole, while the other is perpindicular to it. The scope has to be balanced by counter-weights to keep the balance point on
        the polar axis. Many equatorial mounts are motorized to aid in consistent tracking. When an astronomical object is sighted, the mount's polar axis rotates 
        the scope counter to the rotation of the Earth, keeping the object in constant view. This is a necessity for long-exposure astrophotography, or digital frame 
        stacking algorithms that require long videos of an object.</p>

      <h2>Astronomical Coordinate Systems</h2>

        <figcaption>An illustration of the law of haversines, which is used to convert between spherical coordinate systems</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There are two main coordinate systems that are useful to astronomers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Horizontal</li>
        <li>Equatorial</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They correspond directly with the axis pairs of the two main types of telescope mounts, and this is not coincidental. Horizontal coordinates are altitude and 
      azimuth, which correspond with the altitude and azimuth axes of alt-azimuth mounts. Equatorial coordinates are right ascension and declination, and these correspond
      with the equatorial mount's polar axis and the axis which is perpendicular to it, respectively.</p>
      <p>The next page on this website explains the relationship between these coordinate systems, how to convert between them, and how they are derived. Lean more
